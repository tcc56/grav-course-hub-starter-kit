The Grav CMS is a modern flat-file CMS which is designed for small to moderate size Web sites. It uses a non-database approach in which content and code are stored separately as text files (often referred to as a flat-file CMS). Grav also supports modular content, which means content can be displayed in multiple areas and contexts but only needs to be stored once.
