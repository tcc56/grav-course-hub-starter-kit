title: Why a Modern Flat-file CMS?

While every project has different needs, I am finding that database-based CMS platforms such as WordPress are often too complex/feature-laden for the needs of _individual_ educators/publishers. In contrast, flat-file CMS platforms offer more simplicity and control. Here are some of the key reasons I am now focusing on using modern flat-file CMSs for my development work (especially when implementing a [flipped LMS](../flipped-lms-approach) approach):

* Modern
 *  Modern PHP code (i.e. reliability, speed, extensibility, etc.)
 *  Use of current standards (i.e. Markdown, Twig, YAML, etc.)
 *  Modular/customizable content chunks (i.e. reuse of content)
 *  Further separation of content (i.e. files) from presentation
* Flat-file
 *  No database means less (or no) IT involvement needed
 *  Content stored in text files rather than in a database (often translating into faster page access times)
 *  Takes full advantage of the collaborative ecosystem now available (i.e. GitHub)
 *  Increased portability, as moving a site now only requires simply copying files to another location
 *  All template and content files are 100% version controllable
