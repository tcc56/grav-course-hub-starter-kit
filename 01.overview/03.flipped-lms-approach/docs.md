A flipped-LMS approach is where an open platform, in the control of instructors and students, serves as an alternative front-end to the institutional LMS.

With this approach, instructors can create better outcomes and experiences for students and themselves _today_. Deep-links to any needed LMS elements (i.e. assignment submissions, discussion forums, grades, etc.) with flow-through for user authentication is the only back-end requirement.

Explore an example flipped-LMS implementation, created for my Simon Fraser University CMPT 363 course and built with the open source CMS [Grav](http://getgrav.org) + Instructure's [Canvas LMS](http://www.canvaslms.com/) at [http://cmpt-363-153.hibbittsdesign.com/](http://cmpt-363-153.hibbittsdesign.com/).
